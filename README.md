# Carolina Fever


Model of a Mobile IOS app to help UNC students track their fever points, check the fever schedule, submit correction forms,
and stay updated on Fever and Carolina sports news. This project is NOT affiliated with Carolina Fever, Carolina Athletics,
or UNC Chapel Hill. This is simply a model of an app still in the making, as I try to work out a partnership with Carolina Fever.

Right now, this app queries my free AWS Parse server for data on Fever games, points, and schedules. This project uses CocoaPods
o use the Parse API and documentation. Also used in the making of this project are tab bar icon downloaded from IconBeast.

There is a video demo of the app in the main directory
